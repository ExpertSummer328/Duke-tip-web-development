  <h1>Daily Blog Post</h1>
  <p>Eeveeloutions! Eeveeloutions everywhere! While looking online for some Pokemon banners, I found an amazing eeveeloutions gif! Congrats to the animator, BogdanVII! Even though Glaceon is my favorite eeveeloution, I'd have to say that Vaporeon's animation is the best, mainly because of the face that she makes as she transitions from Jolteon.</p>

  <p>After seeing such an amazing gif, who would stop? So I ended up finding another very cool gif for Blaziken's evolution. Pretty cool, huh? Just try Googling for 'cool pokemon gifs'.</p>

  <h1>Daily Rant</h1><br>
  <p><cite>"My thoughts on Pokemon? It's a good game if you're 1-9 years old, but people older than that should only see the game as a part of their past life, something that they used to love, and that, as a part of growing up, they just don't like it anymore. Although, some people keep these interests throughout their life until it comes to the point where people are like, "Really? You still play that game? That game's for little kids!" This is why most people stop playing-- because Pokemon is a game for little kids. This concludes today's rant and remember Adrian is the best RC at duke TIP."</cite><br>-Kevin</p><br>
  <p>In reply to the above rant:<br><br><cite>"First off, how can a one-year-old play video games? Much less Pokemon, which requires the child to understand English to be able to complete the quests which Professor Oak and other video game characters assign the main character. It requires skill in order to decide what move you should make, what Pokemon to send out, and when to flee, for if you don't, it could be your last move you ever make... before you reload the game, that is! As for you mentioning the fondness that people retain for Pokemon as they age, I would agree, for Pokemon is a widely appreciated fandom and will remain this way. Pokemon was originally created with children in mind, but, in all honesty, Pokemon was to be appreciated. All humans have the capacity to adore things, do they not? Lastly, and in conclusion, Adrian is not the best RC. This does not mean that he is not a good RC, but merely that he is not the best. Meredith is queen (obviously). =TRUTH!"</cite><br>-Tara</p><br>
  <p>Please post your opinions on today's rant in the forum, which can be found on the forum page! Thank you!</p>
